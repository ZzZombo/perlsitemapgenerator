===3. Uploading the necessary files===

You should upload the following files to your web server in a location you can access from a command line:

    * *config.xml* —this is the configuration file you just created using *example_config.xml*.
    * *sitemap_gen.pl* —this is the Perl script that generates your Sitemap.
    * *urllist.txt* —this file is optional; you only need to include it if you used the text file method of generating a Sitemap.

The method you use to upload these files depends on your environment. Common methods include FTP and SCP. For more information, contact your web host.

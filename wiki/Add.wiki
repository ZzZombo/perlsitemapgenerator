===5. Adding the generated sitemap===

The Sitemap Generator creates a *sitemap.xml* file in the location you specified in the config file. Once this file is successfully created, make sure it is accessible through a web browser. Then, [http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=34575&topic=8496 add] it to your [https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/siteoverview Google Sitemaps account]. This enables Google to provide you with useful status and statistical information. If Google reports problems with your Sitemap, you can correct the problems and resubmit it. You only have to add the Sitemap manually once. After that, you can use an HTTP request to notify Google about changes to your Sitemap (although you can also resubmit it through your Google webmaster tools account).
